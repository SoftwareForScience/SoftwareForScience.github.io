<p>Since 2017 the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences collaborates with CERN by doing research for ALICE. ALICE detects the collision between large ions such as lead resulting in quark-gluon plasma which is believed to have existed just a few milliseconds after the Big Bang. After the quark-gluon plasma is resolved an enormous number of particles is emitted and detected by ALICE. The detection is transformed into data which has to be processed and made available for physicists doing research on the smallest particles imaginable.</p>

<p>The data produced by ALICE is being studied by physicists to discover the working of these particles. To be scientific reliable these scientist have to know how the data is produced and for this they use a bookkeeping system. When the LHC is doing its runs and ALICE is gathering data so called shifters are monitoring its operation. Elements of the detector and shifters produce information about there doings which is preserved in a logbook. The data which is produced by ALICE also has to be evaluated generating meta data which also has to be preserved in a bookkeeping system. Part of the research for CERN done by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences focuses on the developing of these systems.</p>

<p>As a team you will work with computer scientists from CERN and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Because this project is just started, requirements and processes still have to be defined and will be part of your job. Implementation of a part of the system will also be done when time permits and you are interested in doing so. The tools you work with consist of NodeJS, JQuery, relational databases and other technologies. This project is done by two teams, i.e. a front end team and a back end team.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences is looking for students Computer Science and students who can make nice Graphical User Interfaces. You will be working at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.</p>
