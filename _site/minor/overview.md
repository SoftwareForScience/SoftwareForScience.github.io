# Minor Software for Science
Software is indispensible in contemporary research. But most often not very much attention is given to the development of this software. The result is that most experiments can not be reproduced while reproducability is an important pillar of scientific progress. During this minor students learn how to develop software according to best practices of scientific programming. During a bootcamp students learn general and specific tools for projects they have chosen to work on. In these projects students work on important scientific experiments such as the Large Hydron Collider (CERN) and the Square Kilometre Array (ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy) or creating software for archaeologists to reconstruct the Via Appia for the eScience Center. In courses scientific methods and programming will be further elaborated. 

The minor Software for Science consists of:

* [the course scientific methods](https://SoftwareForScience.github.io/minor/scientific_method)

* [the course scientific programming](https://SoftwareForScience.github.io/minor/scientific_programming)

* [a variety of projects](https://SoftwareForScience.github.io/minor/projects)
