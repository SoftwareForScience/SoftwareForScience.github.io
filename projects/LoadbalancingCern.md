# Load balancing for the ALICE Collaboration
The enormous number of particles generates a data stream of approximately 1.1 Terabyte per second received by 268 First Level Processors. From the FLPs the data stream has to be distributed among 1500 Event Processing Nodes. You will learn to create and describe experiments which enhance our understanding of the most adequate algorithm for load balancing at ALICE. Tools to be used are C++, GNU/Linux, etc. Furthermore, you will learn to control a build environment.
