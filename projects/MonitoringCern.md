Since 2017 the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences collaborates with CERN by doing research for ALICE. ALICE detects the collision between large ions such as lead resulting in quark-gluon plasma which is believed to have existed just a few milliseconds after the Big Bang. After the quark-gluon plasma is resolved an enormous number of particles is emitted and detected by ALICE. The detection is transformed into data which has to be processed and made available for physicists doing research on the smallest particles imaginable. 

To monitor this process and when necessary intervene an application for use in the operator room has to be developed. First the data has to be gathered, then processed and at last shown. The research focuses on finding the most adequate visualization of different sorts of information. 

As a team you will work with computer scientists from CERN and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The tools you work with consist of Go, NodeJS, Ansible, Collectd, Apache Kafka and Grafana, among others. Experiments are done on a set of computers situated at Nikhef. It will be your job to create and describe experiments which leads to the best visualization of information.

The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences is looking for students Computer Science and students who can make nice Graphical User Interfaces.. You will be working at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
